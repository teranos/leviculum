//! Battery voltage monitor on the WisMesh Pocket V2 (RAK19026 VC baseboard).
//!
//! Battery sense is on **P0.05 / AIN3** through a 1.5/2.5 voltage divider
//! (multiplier 1.73). The SAADC is configured single-ended with the
//! internal 0.6 V reference and `Gain::GAIN1_6` so full-scale at the pin
//! reads 3.6 V — adequate headroom even when a freshly-charged 1S LiPo
//! sits at ~4.2 V which divides to ~2.5 V at the ADC pin.
//!
//! Cell-count detection: the WisMesh Pocket V2 ships with a 1S LiPo, but
//! some RAK4631-based dev kits use a 2S pack. We classify on the first
//! sample (1S maxes near 4.4 V, 2S floors above ~6.0 V — they don't
//! overlap), and stick with the result for the lifetime of the task.
//! Persistent storage is deferred until the identity-store / NVMC-sharing
//! refactor lands; redoing the classification on every boot costs one
//! ADC reading.
//!
//! Voltage-to-percent: per-cell LiPo OCV curve borrowed verbatim from
//! `meshtastic/src/power.h:13-22`, multiplied by the detected cell count
//! for the threshold values.
