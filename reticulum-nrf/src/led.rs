//! Activity-blink tasks for the two on-module LEDs of the RAK4631.
//!
//! Hardware:
//! - LED1 (green, P1.03)  — TX activity indicator
//! - LED2 (blue,  P1.04)  — RX activity indicator
//!
//! Both are driven from `embassy_sync::signal::Signal`s in
//! `crate::baseboard`. The LoRa task raises a signal at every successful
//! TX-done / RX-frame-reassembly, and a tiny task per LED converts each
//! signal into an ~80 ms pulse with a forced 30 ms off period. The off
//! window matters: a burst of completions inside one 80 ms span would
//! otherwise look like a single longer flash and the user couldn't count
//! the events.
//!
//! Module is gated on the same `display` feature as the rest of the
//! baseboard tasks — no LEDs without the rest of the user-facing
//! peripherals.
