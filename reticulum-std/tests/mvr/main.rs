//! Minimum-viable-reproduction (mvr) test tier.
//!
//! See CLAUDE.md §Protocol debugging discipline for the policy these tests
//! implement. Each file here isolates one named protocol-layer failure from
//! the full-scenario tests so that it runs deterministically in seconds
//! rather than minutes, with full structured event logs on failure.
//!
//! mvrs must not depend on LoRa hardware, Docker, or Python. When a full-
//! scenario bug reproduces over a non-LoRa transport, the mvr builds that
//! transport from process primitives and holds the rest of the protocol
//! stack (daemon, client tools, resource machinery) unchanged.
