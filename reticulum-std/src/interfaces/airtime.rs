//! Airtime credit bucket for LoRa-Serial interfaces.
//!
//! Models the per-interface airtime budget as a signed credit that
//! decreases by `airtime_ms(len)` on every `try_send` and regenerates
//! at wall-clock rate. When a charge would push the credit below
//! `threshold_ms`, the interface signals `BufferFull` instead of
//! flooding the host-side serial queue (which on SF10 would absorb
//! ~14 minutes of backlog before the mpsc itself fills).
//!
//! See `~/.claude/instructions.md` (Bug #3 Phase 2a) + the earlier
//! architecture dialogue in `~/.claude/report.md` for why this lives
//! host-side (`reticulum-std`) and never leaks into `reticulum-core`.
