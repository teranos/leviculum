# Broadcast behaviour: Python-RNS parity reference

This document is the source-of-truth reference that our Rust
`reticulum-core` broadcast code must match. It records what
Python-Reticulum does for every broadcast-related mechanism,
citing `vendor/Reticulum/RNS/Transport.py` (and neighbouring files)
by line. The companion mapping table at the end records the
Rust-side implementation or intentional divergence for each item.

The rule (Lew, 2026-04-15): Leviculum matches Python-RNS exactly
for on-wire packet counts, packet types, and protocol semantics.
Timing may diverge — jitter-window shape and interface pacing are
free — as long as the counts and types stay identical.

## 1. Overview: what can appear on the wire

Python-Reticulum emits five distinct packet classes that can be
broadcast or unicast:

| Class | Packet type | Scope | Who originates |
|---|---|---|---|
| Self-announce | `Packet.ANNOUNCE` | Broadcast | `Destination.announce()` |
| Forwarded announce | `Packet.ANNOUNCE` | Broadcast | Transport relay on received announce |
| Path-request | `Packet.DATA` with `transport_type = BROADCAST` | Broadcast | `Transport.request_path()` or client call |
| Path-response | `Packet.ANNOUNCE` with `context = PATH_RESPONSE` | Targeted | Transport answering a path-request |
| Link-request | `Packet.LINKREQUEST` | Unicast | `Link.__init__` on initiator |

Everything below walks each class.

## 2. Self-originated announce

### Trigger

`Destination.announce(app_data, path_response=False, ...)` at
`vendor/Reticulum/RNS/Destination.py:243`. Builds an announce
packet, calls `announce_packet.send()` once at line 322.

### On-wire behaviour

`Packet.send()` at `vendor/Reticulum/RNS/Packet.py:273-299` calls
`Transport.outbound(self)` exactly once and returns a receipt (or
`False`). There is **no retry loop** on the send path. A second
call on the same packet raises `IOError` (Packet.py guard).

### Fan-out across interfaces

Inside `Transport.outbound()` at
`vendor/Reticulum/RNS/Transport.py:1025-1167`: for broadcast
packets (the "else" branch after the targeted-path and
transport-id branches), the code iterates `Transport.interfaces`
(line 1027) and transmits on each. There is **no
`if interface != packet.receiving_interface` filter** in the
announce path. For self-originated announces `receiving_interface`
is `None` anyway (the packet was created locally) so the question
is moot, but the point is relevant when we contrast with the
forwarded-announce path below.

Mode-based filtering is applied in this loop at lines 1040-1084
for `MODE_ACCESS_POINT`, `MODE_ROAMING`, `MODE_BOUNDARY`. These
modes suppress the rebroadcast on specific interfaces depending
on where the destination sits in the mesh. Bandwidth-cap logic
(lines 1089-1162) defers transmissions when the interface is
saturated.

**Summary: Python self-announce = exactly 1 on-wire broadcast per
call, via one-shot `Packet.send()`. Count = 1.**

## 3. Received-for-forwarding announce

### Reception

`Transport.inbound(data, interface)` at `Transport.py:1179+` is
the entry point for everything received on an interface. The
packet-hash dedup check at line 1227 is:

```python
if not packet.packet_hash in Transport.packet_hashlist and
   not packet.packet_hash in Transport.packet_hashlist_prev:
    return True
```

`Transport.packet_hashlist` at `Transport.py:99` is `set()`.
`Transport.packet_hashlist_prev` at line 100 is the rolling
previous window used to keep the dedup memory constant-bounded.
A duplicate return here bails out of `inbound()` before any
announce-specific handling. This is the only mechanism that
prevents the same packet from being processed twice — critical
for the broadcast-back-to-source echo pattern that B1 relies on.

### Insertion into announce_table

For announces (`packet.packet_type == ANNOUNCE`) that pass dedup,
the code path at `Transport.py:1722-1764` initialises an
`announce_table` entry:

```python
retries            = 0                                # line 1722
local_rebroadcasts = 0                                # line 1724
block_rebroadcasts = False                            # line 1725
attached_interface = None                             # line 1726
retransmit_timeout = now + (RNS.rand() * PATHFINDER_RW)  # line 1728
```

`PATHFINDER_RW = 0.5` (seconds) at line 69, so the first
retransmission is scheduled within 0–500 ms of receipt.

Line 1748-1752 is the special case for announces that arrived
**from a local client** (shared-instance peer over the local
socket):

```python
if Transport.from_local_client(packet):
    retransmit_timeout = now
    retries = Transport.PATHFINDER_R
```

This sets `retries = 1` right away. Combined with the retry-loop
guard below, this makes local-client-sourced announces fire
**only 1 time** from the scheduler, not 2.

### Retry loop

The periodic job at `Transport.py:519-532` walks `announce_table`:

```python
for destination_hash in Transport.announce_table:
    announce_entry = Transport.announce_table[destination_hash]
    if announce_entry[IDX_AT_RETRIES] > 0 and
       announce_entry[IDX_AT_RETRIES] >= Transport.LOCAL_REBROADCASTS_MAX:
        # "local rebroadcast limit reached"
        completed_announces.append(destination_hash)
    elif announce_entry[IDX_AT_RETRIES] > Transport.PATHFINDER_R:
        # "retry limit reached"
        completed_announces.append(destination_hash)
    else:
        if time.time() > announce_entry[IDX_AT_RTRNS_TMO]:
            announce_entry[IDX_AT_RTRNS_TMO] =
                time.time() + Transport.PATHFINDER_G + Transport.PATHFINDER_RW
            announce_entry[IDX_AT_RETRIES] += 1
            # ... build rebroadcast packet and send
```

With the constants:

| Constant | Value | Citation |
|---|---:|---|
| `PATHFINDER_R` | 1 | `Transport.py:67` |
| `PATHFINDER_G` | 5 s | `Transport.py:68` |
| `PATHFINDER_RW` | 0.5 s | `Transport.py:69` |
| `LOCAL_REBROADCASTS_MAX` | 2 | `Transport.py:76` |

### Deterministic walk — non-local-client source

Entry inserted with `retries = 0, retransmit_at = now + rand*0.5s`.

| Tick | retries in | Guard A | Guard B | Action | retries out |
|---|---:|---|---|---|---:|
| 1 | 0 | `0 > 0 && 0 >= 2` = false | `0 > 1` = false | fire, schedule next | 1 |
| 2 | 1 | `1 > 0 && 1 >= 2` = false | `1 > 1` = false | fire, schedule next | 2 |
| 3 | 2 | `2 > 0 && 2 >= 2` = **true** | — | remove | — |

**Count = 2 rebroadcasts per received non-local-client announce.**

### Deterministic walk — local-client source

Entry inserted with `retries = 1, retransmit_at = now`.

| Tick | retries in | Guard A | Guard B | Action | retries out |
|---|---:|---|---|---|---:|
| 1 | 1 | `1 > 0 && 1 >= 2` = false | `1 > 1` = false | fire, schedule next | 2 |
| 2 | 2 | `2 > 0 && 2 >= 2` = **true** | — | remove | — |

**Count = 1 rebroadcast per received local-client-sourced announce.**

### Immediate local-client forward

Lines 1788-1833: after the table insertion, Python also emits the
announce immediately to every local-client interface that is
**not** the receiving interface:

```python
for local_interface in Transport.local_client_interfaces:
    if packet.receiving_interface != local_interface:
        new_announce = RNS.Packet(...)
        new_announce.send()
```

This is the only place in the announce path where `receiving_interface`
filtering happens. It only applies to local-client interfaces — the
fanout onto LoRa, TCP, UDP interfaces is unfiltered. This confirms
that for the mixed LoRa-Serial + LoRa-RF topology our tests care
about, Python does **not** skip the received interface when
rebroadcasting.

### Fan-out per rebroadcast fire

Each fire builds a new announce packet (lines 540-561), calls
`send()` → `Transport.outbound()`, which applies the mode
filtering and bandwidth-cap logic. The receiving interface is
implicitly included in the `for interface in Transport.interfaces`
loop (no exclusion check). Echoes are absorbed by the
packet_hashlist check at line 1227 when they arrive back.

### Block-rebroadcasts path

`announce_entry[IDX_AT_BLCK_RBRD]` set to `True` (indices at
line 557 of the retry loop) reroutes the rebroadcast as a
`PATH_RESPONSE` packet (`announce_context = PATH_RESPONSE`,
line 537). This is how path-responses ride the same scheduler.

## 4. Path-request

### Trigger

`Transport.request_path(destination_hash, ...)` at
`Transport.py:2541` is the main producer. Clients call into it
via `Destination.request_path()` or explicit transport calls.

### On-wire behaviour

At line 2561-2587: builds a `Packet` with
`packet_type = Packet.DATA` and
`transport_type = Transport.BROADCAST`, then calls
`packet.send()` once. Same one-shot pattern as self-announce.

Fan-out goes through the same `Transport.outbound()` broadcast
loop at `Transport.py:1025-1167`.

**Count = 1 on-wire broadcast per path-request call. No
retries in the scheduler for path-requests.**

### Rate-limiting

Path-requests are subject to `PATH_REQUEST_MI = 20` seconds
minimum interval per destination (`Transport.py:81`) — clients
requesting the same path more often are throttled upstream of
`Transport.outbound()`.

## 5. Path-response

### Trigger

Two paths produce a `PATH_RESPONSE`:

1. **Active answer**: Transport receives a path-request, has the
   path, calls `Destination.announce(path_response=True, tag=...)`
   with the matching identity. This produces a
   `Packet.ANNOUNCE` with `context = PATH_RESPONSE`
   (`Destination.py:309-310, 319-322`) and sends it once.
2. **Rebroadcast with block_rebroadcasts**: the retry loop at
   `Transport.py:519-540` emits path-responses when
   `announce_entry[IDX_AT_BLCK_RBRD]` is set. Same 2-fire count
   as a regular received-announce rebroadcast.

### On-wire semantics

Path-responses are a packet-type subset of announces. The
fan-out logic is the same as announces. Consumers distinguish
by `packet.context == PATH_RESPONSE`.

### Special routing

In `Transport.outbound()` at lines 1167+ (targeted-transport
branch), a packet with `transport_id` set AND a known next-hop
in `path_table` is routed to a single specific interface via
`SendPacket`, not broadcast. This is what happens when a
path-response is specifically addressed to the path-requester
rather than broadcast. In our Rust code this corresponds to
the `target_interface: Some(idx)` branch at `transport.rs:4055-4070`.

## 6. Link-request

### Trigger

`Link.__init__(destination=...)` on the initiator. Internally
calls `Packet(destination, link_data, Packet.LINKREQUEST, ...)`
and sends it.

### On-wire behaviour

`Packet.LINKREQUEST` (`Packet.py:62`) is **unicast**, not
broadcast. At `Transport.py:1938`: local-destination link
requests are dispatched to the destination's attached interface
directly. Non-local paths route through next-hop. There is no
broadcast fanout.

**Count = 1 unicast packet per link initiation. Not relevant to
broadcast parity directly, but enumerated here for completeness.**

## 7. Dedup (packet_hashlist)

| Item | Value | Citation |
|---|---|---|
| Storage | `set()` | `Transport.py:99` |
| Previous-window storage | `set()` | `Transport.py:100` |
| Max size | 1 000 000 entries | `Transport.py:145` |
| Check site | line 1227 | `Transport.py` |
| Rotation | half-cleared when reaches `hashlist_maxsize/2` | approximate, see cull job |

The dedup check is the **only** mechanism that prevents the
self-heard echo when we (Rust) stop excluding the receiving
interface from the rebroadcast fanout. Verifying the check fires
reliably is a hard requirement for B1.

## 8. ANNOUNCE_CAP — per-interface rate limiter

### Constants

| Constant | Value | Citation |
|---|---:|---|
| `Reticulum.ANNOUNCE_CAP` | 2 (percent of bandwidth) | `Reticulum.py:116` |

Interface instances set
`interface.announce_cap = Reticulum.ANNOUNCE_CAP/100.0 = 0.02`
at `Reticulum.py:731`. Each interface also has
`interface.bitrate` (bps).

### Logic

The rate limiter is consulted **only** for forwarded announces
(`packet.hops > 0`). Self-originated announces bypass it because
they only fire once and are not worth deferring.

At `Transport.py:1091-1161`:

```python
if (packet.hops > 0):
    if not hasattr(interface, "announce_cap"): ...
    if not hasattr(interface, "announce_allowed_at"):
        interface.announce_allowed_at = 0

    if time.time() >= interface.announce_allowed_at and interface.bitrate:
        tx_time    = len(packet.raw) * 8 / interface.bitrate
        wait_time  = tx_time / interface.announce_cap
        interface.announce_allowed_at = time.time() + wait_time
        # proceed with immediate TX
    else:
        # queue for later
        if not len(interface.announce_queue) >= Reticulum.MAX_QUEUED_ANNOUNCES:
            interface.announce_queue.append(packet)
```

`wait_time = tx_time / 0.02 = 50 × tx_time`: each forwarded
announce "books" 50× its own airtime on the interface before the
next forwarded announce is allowed immediate TX.

### Queue drain

When `announce_allowed_at` rolls past and there are queued
announces, the interface's `process_announce_queue()` pops the
next one and emits it. This is a per-interface deferred-send
mechanism, not a transport-wide one.

## 9. LOCAL_REBROADCASTS_MAX

Covered in section 3 (retry loop). The enforcement sites are:

- `Transport.py:523`: retry-loop guard A. Prevents emission when
  `retries >= LOCAL_REBROADCASTS_MAX`.
- `Transport.py:1588`: secondary site that removes an entry from
  `announce_table` when a duplicate announce arrives and the
  local rebroadcast counter has saturated. This is the "I'm
  hearing too many copies of this announce from others, stop
  my own rebroadcast too" path.

## 10. Management announce keepalive

### Constants

| Constant | Value | Citation |
|---|---:|---|
| `mgmt_announce_interval` | 7 200 s (2 h) | `Transport.py:162` |
| Initial-fire trick | `last_mgmt_announce = now - interval + 15` | `Transport.py:247` |

### Behaviour

`Transport.py:247` runs at startup and sets `last_mgmt_announce`
to 15 seconds ago minus the full interval, so the next check at
`Transport.py:835` fires ~15 s after startup. Each fire walks
`Transport.mgmt_destinations` (a list of transport-control
destinations like probe responders and blackhole destinations,
populated at lines 220-241, 367 during `Transport.start()`) and
announces each.

After each successful batch the code updates
`Transport.last_mgmt_announce = time.time()`.

### Purpose

Without this keepalive, a node that loses its initial one-shot
`Destination.announce()` is unreachable until the next manual
announce. The 2-h re-announce gives the mesh a periodic refresh
without flooding the network with announce traffic.

## 11. Interface modes

Python-Reticulum distinguishes five interface modes
(`Interfaces/Interface.py:45-50`):

| Mode | Constant | Intent |
|---|---|---|
| `MODE_FULL` | 0x01 | Default. Fully participating transport node. |
| `MODE_POINT_TO_POINT` | 0x02 | Directed link, no announce flooding. |
| `MODE_ACCESS_POINT` | 0x03 | Gateway to clients. Special path expiry. |
| `MODE_ROAMING` | 0x04 | Mobile node. Selective rebroadcast. |
| `MODE_BOUNDARY` | 0x05 | Edge between mesh segments. Selective rebroadcast. |
| `MODE_GATEWAY` | 0x06 | Inter-mesh gateway. |

These are consulted in `Transport.outbound()` at lines 1040-1084
to suppress rebroadcast on specific interfaces.
`block_rebroadcasts` at the announce-table entry level is a
related per-entry flag.

**Leviculum does not implement interface modes.** All interfaces
behave as `MODE_FULL`. This is a documented divergence that Phase
A audit records; if a future scenario surfaces that requires
mode behaviour, a separate task lands them. Until then, our
fanout is "unfiltered over the broadcast-capable interface set",
which is behaviourally equivalent to Python with all interfaces
in `MODE_FULL`.

## 13. Phase A resolutions of semantic ambiguities

### B2 retry-count alignment

**Question**: `PATHFINDER_R = 1` — does this mean 1 retry after
the initial or 1 TX total?

**Resolution** (walking the Python loop, section 3): Python fires
**2 times** per received non-local-client announce, bounded by
`LOCAL_REBROADCASTS_MAX = 2` not by `PATHFINDER_R`. The
`PATHFINDER_R` guard (`retries > PATHFINDER_R`) would fire at
`retries = 2` but `LOCAL_REBROADCASTS_MAX` fires first at
`retries >= 2`. In other words, for the default constants the
`PATHFINDER_R` guard is redundant with `LOCAL_REBROADCASTS_MAX`
in the non-local-client path.

**Rust equivalent target**: 2 fires per received non-local-client
announce. Achievable in two ways:

- A. Set `PATHFINDER_RETRIES = 1` **and** change the entry-insert
  at `transport.rs:1973-1974` from `retries: 1` to `retries: 0`.
  Guards at `transport.rs:3944-3945` already read
  `retries > PATHFINDER_RETRIES` and `local_rebroadcasts >=
  LOCAL_REBROADCASTS_MAX`; both fire at the right count.
- B. Set `PATHFINDER_RETRIES = 2` and leave insert at
  `retries: 1`. Same on-wire count.

**B2 commits path A** — it more closely mirrors Python's
constants and counter semantics, so future upstream-audit
readers see 1:1 constants.

### B1 fanout alignment

**Question**: if we remove `exclude_iface`, can dedup reliably
catch the self-echo?

**Resolution**: yes. Outgoing broadcasts go through
`send_on_all_interfaces` at `transport.rs:1243-1255` which calls
`self.storage.add_packet_hash()` before emitting the
`Action::Broadcast`. The dedup check at `transport.rs:1179`
in `process_incoming` reads that set. The only edge case is the
dedup window rollover at `HASHLIST_MAXSIZE = 1 000 000` entries —
a packet that is ~1M packets old could theoretically come back.
Not a concern in practice for single-day bench runs; flag as a
known-limitation comment in the B1 commit.

### Mode-less Rust

**Decision**: Leviculum continues without interface modes.
Documented as a deliberate scope reduction. Our scenarios and the
Python peer we interop against all use `MODE_FULL` implicitly.
A future Bug that requires `MODE_ROAMING` or similar gets its
own task; this parity doc predates and outscopes that work.

## 14. Usage

This document is the audit target for both sides:

- When we upgrade the vendored `RNS/` tree to a new upstream
  release, the Python line numbers here are the first thing to
  re-verify. A changed line number is a hint the behaviour may
  have shifted; a changed mechanism is a new parity task.
- When we add a new broadcast code path to
  `reticulum-core`, we extend the parity matrix (section 12) and
  add a test under `reticulum-std/tests/rnsd_interop/` that
  verifies the new path matches what a live Python peer sees.

The parity matrix is the contract. Everything else in this
document is the reading behind the entries.
