//! Persistence trait for ratchet keys (forward secrecy).
//!
//! Two types of ratchet data:
//! - Known ratchets (receiver-side): ratchet public key + received timestamp
//! - Dest ratchet keys (sender-side): opaque serialized bytes
//!
//! Both are stored per-destination (keyed by truncated hash).
//! On std, each destination is a separate file in `ratchets/` or `ratchetkeys/`.
