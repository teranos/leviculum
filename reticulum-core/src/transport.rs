//! Transport layer - routing, path discovery, packet handling (sans-I/O)
//!
//! The Transport is the heart of the Reticulum protocol. It manages:
//! - Packet routing based on destination hash
//! - Path discovery via announce propagation
//! - Link table management
//! - Duplicate packet detection
//!
//! # Sans-I/O Design
//!
//! Transport never performs I/O directly. Instead it:
//! - Accepts incoming packets via `process_incoming(iface_index, data)`
//! - Emits outbound I/O as `Action` values (`SendPacket`, `Broadcast`)
//! - Emits protocol events via `drain_events()`
//!
//! The driver (in `reticulum-std` or an embedded crate) owns the interfaces,
//! handles framing, and dispatches Actions to the network.
//!
//! ```text
//! use reticulum_core::transport::{Transport, TransportConfig};
//!
//! let mut transport = Transport::new(config, clock, storage, identity);
//!
//! // Driver feeds incoming packets:
//! transport.process_incoming(iface_index, &raw_data)?;
//!
//! // Driver dispatches outbound actions:
//! for action in transport.drain_actions() {
//!     // send via interface
//! }
//!
//! // Driver runs periodic maintenance:
//! transport.poll();
//! ```
