//! Heapless Storage implementation for embedded targets (nRF52840).
//!
//! Uses `heapless::FnvIndexMap` and `heapless::IndexSet` with compile-time
//! capacities instead of `BTreeMap`/`BTreeSet`. Eliminates allocator overhead
//! for map containers ; only variable-size data fields (`Vec<u8>` in announce
//! cache and ratchet keys) still use the heap allocator.
//!
//! Local client (shared-instance) methods are no-ops ; embedded nodes are the
//! daemon, not a client of a daemon.
